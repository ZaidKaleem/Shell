# Shell
Project Description 60­330 Final Project Our program implements an interface for a shell by taking in a command from the user. The program then parses that command and executes it in a child process. Checks for the following cases are done before execution. 1. If command entered by the user is “exit” then the program will stop. 2. If command entered by the user is “history” then the program will print the previous commands entered by the user up to 10 commands. Commands are printed from most recent to least recent. 3. If command entered by the user is “!!” then the most recent command will be executed. “!!” executed the previous command as long as there are less than commands in history. 4. If command entered by the user is “!” followed by a number of a command from the history (!num) then the corresponding command from the history will be executed.
